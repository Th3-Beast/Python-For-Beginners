# Loop Based Practise

# Find the Minimum

# Write a program that reads how many numbers will follow,
# then finds and prints the smallest number among them.

# Input:
# 4
# 8
# 3
# 11
# 5
#
# Expected output: 3

Detailed Breakdown

This is similar to finding the maximum:

1. Read the first input to know how many numbers are coming.
2. Initialize a variable called `min_number` to a very large value (like `999999`).
3. Loop through all the numbers.
4. For each number, check if it's smaller than `min_number`.
5. If it is, update `min_number` to be this new number.
6. After the loop, print `min_number`.
