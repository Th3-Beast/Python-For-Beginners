# Loop Based Practise

# Multiply All Numbers

# Write a program that reads how many numbers will follow,
# then multiplies all those numbers together and prints the result.

# Input:
# 3
# 2
# 5
# 3
#
# Expected output: 30

Detailed Breakdown

Multiplication works differently from addition:

1. Read the first input to know how many numbers are coming.
2. Initialize a variable called `product` to `1` (not `0`! Why? Because anything multiplied by 0 is 0).
3. Loop through all the numbers.
4. For each number, multiply `product` by that number.
5. After the loop, print `product`.
