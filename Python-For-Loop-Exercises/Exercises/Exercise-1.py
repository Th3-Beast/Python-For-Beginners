# Loop Based Practise

# Sum of N Numbers

# Write a program that gets 3 input values from the user.
# The first input tells you how many numbers will follow.
# The next 2 inputs should be whole numbers, that you need to sum.
# Print the sum of all the input numbers (not including the first input).

# Example:
# Input:
# 3
# 1
# 5
# 6

# Expected Output: 12

"""
Detailed Breakdown:

Your task is to:
1. Read the first input value and store it. This value dictates how many times you'll need to read input in the next step.
2. Initialize a variable called `total` and set it to `0`.
3. Use a loop that repeats exactly as many times as the first input number indicated.
4. Inside each iteration of your loop, read one of the subsequent input numbers.
5. Convert that input number to an integer and add it to your `total` variable.
6. Once your loop has finished, print out the final value of your `total`.
