# Loop Based Practise

# Count Positive Numbers

# Write a program that reads how many numbers will follow,
# then counts how many of those numbers are positive (greater than 0). Print the count.

# Input:
# 5
# -3
# 7
# 0
# -1
# 5
#
# Expected output: 2

Detailed Breakdown

Here's how to approach it:

1. Read the first input to know how many numbers are coming.
2. Initialize a counter to `0`.
3. Loop through all the numbers.
4. For each number, check if it's greater than `0`.
5. If it is, increase the counter by 1.
6. After the loop, print the counter.
