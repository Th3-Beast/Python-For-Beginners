# Loop Based Practise

# Count Even Numbers

# Write a program that reads how many numbers will follow,
# then counts how many of those numbers are even.
# Print the count of even numbers.

# Example:
# Input:
# 5
# 2
# 7
# 4
# 9
# 6

# Expected output: 3

"""
Detailed Breakdown:

Here's what you need to do:
1. Read the first input to know how many numbers are coming.
2. Initialize a counter variable to 0.
3. Loop that many times, reading one number each time.
4. Check if the number is even (hint: use the modulo operator % - if number % 2 == 0, it's even).
5. If it's even, increase your counter by 1.
6. After the loop, print the counter.
