# Loop Based Practise

# Find the Maximum

# Write a program that reads how many numbers will follow,
# then finds and prints the largest number among them.

# Input:
# 4
# 3
# 9
# 2
# 7
#
# Expected output: 9

Detailed Breakdown

Steps to solve this:

1. Read the first input to know how many numbers are coming.
2. Initialize a variable called `max_number` to a very small value (like `-999999` or read the first number).
3. Loop through all the numbers.
4. For each number, check if it's greater than `max_number`.
5. If it is, update `max_number` to be this new number.
6. After the loop, print `max_number`.
