# Loop Based Practise

# Average Calculator

# Write a program that reads how many numbers will follow,
# then calculates and prints the average of those numbers.

# Input:
# 4
# 10
# 20
# 30
# 40
#
# Expected output: 25.0

Detailed Breakdown

To calculate an average:

1. Read the first input to know how many numbers are coming (let's call this `count`).
2. Initialize a `total` variable to `0`.
3. Loop `count` times, reading each number and adding it to `total`.
4. After the loop, divide `total` by `count` to get the average.
5. Print the average.
