## 🌟 What Is This Repository?

This is a **topic-based Python practice repository** designed to help beginners strengthen specific weak areas.

Instead of random mixed exercises, everything is grouped into folders like:

- 🔄 `for_loop_practice`
- ⏳ `while_loop_practice`
- 📚 `collection_practice`
- 🔑 `dictionary_practice`
- ⚙️ `function_practice`
- 🧠 More coming soon...

If loops confuse you, train loops.  
If collections trip you up, train collections.  
Target your weak spots. Build confidence. Level up deliberately.
